###### Project in  Deep learning- Endometriosis

In this project we present a predictive model for women with endometriosis

Endometriosis is a chronic disease that develops only in women.
The cause is genetic and the ability to diagnose the disease is terribly slow.
Lots of women suffer from different daily symptoms which do not always indicate the presence of the disease and therefore women are diagnosed at the age of 30+.


Our modle contains Three systems that capable to identifying endometriosis by detecting its symptoms.
1.	logistic regression.
2.	Neural Networks with two hidden layers.
3.	Our Neural Networks get addition of skip connection and Batch Normalization.

We defined two type of women in this Dataset. Half sick in endometriosis and Half are not.

We ran the three models on the same Dataset. We got a different results in each model and faced with different problems any time.
Therefore, there are conclusions for each model.


In conclusion:
